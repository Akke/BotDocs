# BotDocs â€” Document your Discord bot
BotDocs is a simple and lightweight file-based, stateless command documentation software for your Discord bot. One does in fact not fit all, and have therefore designed this project with a lot of configuration and customization options in mind, making sure you can tailor it to your taste.

**Primary features**
* Organized documentation of commands, with arguments, aliases, usage examples and much more.
* Extended command descriptions (replace the JSON description property with data from an .md file)
* Multi-language support: English, Swedish and Turkish.
* Simple and sleek frontend design with custom theme support (comes with 3 themes by default: light, midnight and discord)
* Extensive configuration support
* Custom pages (create custom pages, separated from the commands, e.g. ToS page)

And most importantly, it's completely open source and **free to use**.

## Installation
1. Download the latest release (https://github.com/Akke/BotDocs/releases/latest) from the releases page.
2. Upload everything to your desired directory.
3. Install all dependencies with `npm i`
4. Double check your commands data in `src/configs/commands.js` (create it, if it doesn't already exist) **NOTE: See below for detailed information about the commands configuration.**
5. Build BotDocs with `npm run build` (if you wish to run in developer mode without building, run `npm run dev`)
6. Run BotDocs with `npm run start`
7. (optional) See https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment for more deployment methods.

### Setting up your commands
BotDocs only supports a single format of commands in form of an object currently.
```js
module.exports = {
    "Informative": [
        {
            "name": "help",
            "aliases": [
                "h"
            ],
            "description": "Gives a link to a website where you can find all the information you need.",
            "usage": "help",
            "params": [
                {
                    "name": "category",
                    "description": "Lock a command category to one channel",
                    "type": "string",
                    "required": true
                },
                {
                    "name": "channel",
                    "description": "Mention a channel with #channelname",
                    "type": "channel",
                    "default": "Takes the channel the command was ran in"
                }
            ],
            "permissions": {
                "logic": "OR",
                "levels": [
                    {
                        "type": "server",
                        "name": "MANAGE_CHANNELS"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```
`Informative` is the category name, where commands should be grouped, but if you don't have any clear categories it would be more suitable to create a "generic" category and place all of your commands inside of that.

The following properties must exist for the application to behave correctly:
* `name` (string)
* `aliases` (array with strings)
* `description` (string)
* `usage` (string)
* `params` (array with objects, see example above)
* **If a command requires a specific permission set:** `permissions` (object, see example above)

## Configuration
The configuration that can be found in `src/configs/app.js` comes with many configuration options.
* `list_mode` - The method of displaying the commands list (`default`, `cards` or `compact`)
    * Default: A regular list with permission set visible and description preview (does not render .md syntax)
    * Cards: Commands displayed in a card view instead of a long list.
    * Compact: A list with reduced paddings to preserve space, as well as redacted permissions and description preview, to only display the command name.
* `locale` - The language all static text should be in, using ISO 639-1 language codes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) **Note: Locales must be added manually before building the application. See below for more information.**
    * `en` (default)
    * `sv` (swedish)
    * `tr` (turkish)
* `enable_pages` - Defaults to `true` and controls whether you want to enable custom pages. The menu link for custom pages will also disappear if set to `false`
* `menu_links` - Custom link properties to replace the default static menu (icons will be disabled). To disable, leave the arrays empty.
    * ```json
      "menu_links": {
            "default": [
                {
                    "name": "Custom Home Link",
                    "target": "/"
                }
            ],
            "custom_pages": [
                {
                    "name": "Terms of Service",
                    "target": "/page/tos"
                }
            ]
        }
        ```
    
* `logo_url` - Public path to the url of your logo to display above the menu (e.g. `/static/images/logos/mylogo.png`)
* `category_colors` - Custom color codes for your categories to add some variety to the design (leave empty to use the themes primary color instead).
    * ```json
      "category_colors": {
           "moderation": "#F00"
       }
       ```

## Translations
Translations are supported if added manually before compiling the application. To do this, you must create a file in `src/data/locales` using an ISO 639-1 language code for the name (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes). 
```
{
    "categories": "Categories",
    "commands": "Commands",
    ...
}
```
Translate the text on the right and leave the keys and variables wrapped in `{{}}` tags alone. You must also modify `src/utils/i18n.js` and import the new language file.

```js
import localeEN from "../data/locales/en.json";
import localeSV from "../data/locales/sv.json";
// new import here

const resources = {
    en: {
        translation: localeEN
    },
    sv: {
        translation: localeSV
    }
    // new language object here, using ISO 639-1 codes
};
```
When all is set, you can change the language in the configuration file.

## Themes
You can change the color scheme and a lot of other properties of the design which is done in SASS. Locate the file `src/styles/theme.sass` and import the theme you wish to use, and comment out the inactive ones. 
```sass
@import "themes/light"
//@import "themes/discord"
//@import "themes/midnight"
```
To edit an existing theme, find the theme inside the themes directory and edit the variables found within.

If you want to create a new theme, simply make a new file in `src/styles/themes/your-new-file.sass` and copy/paste the variables from an existing theme file.

## Custom Pages
You can also use BotDocs to serve regular, static pages, which you can disable in the configuration (enabled by default). Simply create file inside the `src/data/pages` directory with the `.md` suffix (markdown). 

Files within the directory will create new URL handles depending on the file name and its subdirectories. For example, if you create `src/data/pages/helloworld.md` it will be served at `yoursite.com/page/helloworld`, and if you create `src/data/pages/my/extended/path/helloworld.md` it will be available at `yoursite.com/page/my/extended/path/helloworld`.

## Extending Commands
Just like you can create custom pages, you can also extend command descriptions using a similar method, with `.md` files and syntax. 

If you have a category called `moderation` and a command named `ban`, you can then create the file `src/data/commands/moderation/ban.md` and everything inside this file will replace the default description property in the commands file.  

You can use this method if you wish to explain into further detail how a command works, or if you wish to include images, links, and so on.
